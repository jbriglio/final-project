well, obviously I’m very excited about our 2018 draft class from top to bottom i think its a really good class and obviously this is always an exciting time I’ve been through this for the third time here and but we do know that this has to parlay onto the field again this is still about winning drafts and at the end of the day its about winning football games and i feel like we put some guys on the team that can help us do that we got a lot of work to do, a lot of work ahead of us, get these young men here and acclimated to we do things here and how we go about it but again from top to bottom i think its a very strong class and again i just want to thank john dorsey and the personnel group for all the work they put into this its a lot of work and the coaching staff its a lot of hours and time and commitment to get things done this way and we had to make some tough decisions we did that and now we are going to move forward with this group and coach them up. 

[on if they think their picks were aggressive and taking a risk]
I’m not going to say more aggressive i just think as a group and how we go about it working together and collaborating and i know it can be seen as more aggressive but i think what we did is totally believe in how we go about it and evaluating players and making decisions about putting players on our team 

[on the backgrounds of some players]
obviously there are some guys in this group with some spots on them but trust me we have done our due diligence and made sure that we have vetted it all out and we feel very good about putting these guys in our organization and theres no question that we have the resources in place to help them through it and we will go from there 

[on the decision behind taking on players with a poor background]
well i think john said it earlier its a case by case basis and i think you really dig into it because you have to and make sure you understand all the different angles of it all to be able to make a decision and when its all said and done we make a decision as an organization and we make a decision all of us will do our part to make it right so i think we feel good about what we know and how we are going to attack the issues

[on the wide receivers they picked]
they are good football players i mean obviously callaway his statistics for the one year, year and a half were outstanding and then radley obviously he doesn’t have lot of numbers but he is a very talent player and has made plays so we are very excited about getting these two young men on our team 

[on where a defensive player  will play]
well we are going to start him off well you know he is versatile he can play tackle he can play guard we will give him a chance to do both and see where he fits but again he is just a really good football player and i don’t think you can have too many good football players and again if we have to do some shuffling along the line when its all said and done we are going to out our best five guys out there 

[on if a player would be at center]
i probably wouldn’t go that far but if need be we would you know because he does have the skill set i think having guys whether they are starter or back up that have the versatility to play all five spots is very important

you may see anything when it is all said and done its my job to make sure that we have the best group of guys out there and if that means that then we will do that 

[on linebacker]
i will start him on the inside but i think he can play all of the different spots obviously he’s going to be a real core special teams guy so there are a lot of different things he can do you know this guy knows how to go sack the quarterback and make plays on the ball so we are excited about him 

[on baker mayfeild] 
i respect that i think that anytime you draft a quarterback at number one overall everyone wants to see him play but i have made a true commitment to our football team and tyrod taylor is going to be the starter and baker is going to compete however that unfolds it unfolds but right now tyrod is the starter if baker can understand the national football league and all the rigors and the grinding that you have to go through I’m not ever going to stop a player from being the best he can be but we have a plan and we will work that plan as much as we can now can a player supersede that you never know i haven’t had that happen but right now this team is going to be lead by tyrod taylor 

I’ve been through this not a number one overall but I’ve been through this the last to years i think i have to do whats best for the football team and the organization and the player and i don’t think you want to put a player out there too soon if they’re not ready to go so we have the luxury to do that and make sure baker is in the right spot before we ever put him in that predicament 

there is a change you know he’s staring at number three right now he’s got a to work his way up he’s got to earn it we are not going to give anybody anything draft status is just that you still have to earn the right to play for the cleveland browns and thats what we are going to create here
